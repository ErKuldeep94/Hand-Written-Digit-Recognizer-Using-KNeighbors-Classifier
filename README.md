# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer-Using-KNeighbors-Classifier
This project is for recognizing Hand Written Digits.It is implemented by using KNeighbors Algorithm which is traditional Machine Learning algorithm.To find the number of neighbors which will give more accuracy cross_validation_score library is used.This project is coded in Python using Scikit-Learn Library.
